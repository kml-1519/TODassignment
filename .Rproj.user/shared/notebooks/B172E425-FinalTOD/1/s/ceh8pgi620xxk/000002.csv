"0","#This next portion of the policy brief will concentrate on data comparisons made between TOD and non-TOD areas. We defined TOD areas as census tracts in D.C. within a half mile of a WMATA metro line. To investigate if TOD areas are truly more desirable to Washingtonians, we will look at the changes in total housing units, population, median rent, median household income, and share of renters from 2000 to 2019."

"0","#Our first indicator that we will look at from 2000 and 2019 is the total population. If areas near transit are deemed more attractive, consumers renting and purchasing housing units will have likely relocated to TOD areas, and therefore may have increased the number of total population along metro stop lines."
