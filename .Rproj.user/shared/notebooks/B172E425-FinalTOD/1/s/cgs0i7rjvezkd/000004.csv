"0","#The two visualizations displayed above shows that D.C.'s population has greatly increased in a 19-year period, with most of the population increase occurring in the northwest quadrants of the district. With one exception in the southeast, TOD areas saw increases in population - though because metro stations are so plentiful in D.C., it is difficult to distinguish if population increases were limited exclusively to TOD areas.

"0","#The second indicator we observed from 2000 to 2019 is median rent. First, it must be noted that all median rent values from 2000 were adjusted for inflation, and are depicted in  2019 dollars. From 2000 to 2019, median rents have increased across the entire district, and appear to be higher in TOD areas. In 2019, most TOD tracts reported a median rent at around $1,699 a month while surrounding cost about $545 less to live in. This may prove D.C. Residents are willing to may more to live near the metro. "
