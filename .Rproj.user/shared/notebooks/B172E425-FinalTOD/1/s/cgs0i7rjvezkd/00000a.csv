"0","#The table below confirms the spatial visualizations depictions of stark increase in median household income, median rent, and total occupied housing units in TOD areas, when compared to non-TOD areas. Although, changes in the percentage of renters and population are both not as stunning, indicating that while TOD areas have increased in rental costs and occupation, they are not as accessible to households earning a modest income, which can explain the marginal population increases.
