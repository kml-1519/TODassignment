"0","#The fourth indicator analyzed is median household income over time from 2000 to 2019.As we contemplated above, the increase in median rents in TOD areas may show that residents are willing to pay more to live in TOD areas.

Generally,the visualizations prove that in recent years (2019) higher income households do indeed live in TOD areas when compared to non-TOD areas. This could mean that those with flexible incomes were choosing to live near transportation.  "
