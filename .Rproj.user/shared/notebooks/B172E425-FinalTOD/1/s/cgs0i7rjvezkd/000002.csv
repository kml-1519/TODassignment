"0","#This portion of the policy brief will concentrate on data comparisons made between TOD and non-TOD areas. TOD areas are defined as census tracts in D.C. within a half mile of a WMATA metro line. Changes in population, median rent, median household income, and share of renters over a period of 2000 to 2019 may provide some insight into the value of TOD areas, and determine if they are more desirable to Washingtonians.

"0","#The first indicator analyzed over 2000 and 2019 is population. If areas near transit are deemed more attractive, consumers renting and purchasing housing units will have likely relocated to TOD areas,or newcomers may have found these areas more convenient thereby increasing the population along metro stop lines."
