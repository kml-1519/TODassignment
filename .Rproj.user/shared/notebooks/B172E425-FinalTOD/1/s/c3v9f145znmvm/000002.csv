"0","#Geom Line Plot, Mean Rent as a Function of Distance to Metro Stations "
"0","#The plot below depicts a half mile buffer around each Metro station, allowing us to conclude that rent prices are lower the further a unit is from a metro station. There are two  clear exceptions to this, as about 2.5 miles away from stations rents seem to peak, though this could be because historically- wealthy  areas prefer to limit transit accessibility as residents want to remain insular or can easily afford a car.
